## COVID-19 Deaths

Link to dataset - https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

In this project, I have used SQL to do some Data Exploration on COVID-19 deaths dataset. I joined two tables named 'CovidDeaths' and 'CovidVaccinations'. Total cases vs total deaths, what percentage of population got covid in Bangladesh, likelihood of dying, countries with highest infection rate compared to population, used CTE, Temp Table and many other queries.

A short video of running the code.
